Up to this point, we've generated four top level routes.

* An `about` route, that gives information on our application.
* A `contact` route, with information on how to contact the company.
* A `rentals` route, where we will allow users to browse rental properties.
* and the `index` route, which we've set up to redirect to the `rentals` route.

Our `rentals` route is going to serve multiple functions.
From our [acceptance tests](../acceptance-test), we've shown that we want our users to be able to browse and search rentals, as well as also to see detailed information for individual rentals.
To satisfy our requirement, we are going to make use of Ember's [nested route capability](../../routing/defining-your-routes/#toc_nested-routes).

By the end of this section we want to have created the following new routes:

* A `rentals/index` route that displays the rentals page's general information, and also lists available rentals.
The index nested route is shown by default when the user visits to the `rentals` URL.
* A `rentals/show` route that still displays the rental page's general information, additionally showing detailed information about a selected rental.
The `show` route will get substituted with the id of the rental being shown. (for example `rentals/grand-old-mansion`).

## The Parent Route

Previously, in the [Routes and Templates tutorial](../routes-and-templates), we set up a `rentals` route. 

Opening the template for this route reveals an outlet underneath the route's general page information.
At the bottom of the template, you'll notice an `{{outlet}}` helper.
This is where the active nested route will be rendered.

```app/templates/rentals.hbs
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>We hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.</p>
  {{#link-to 'about' class="button"}}
    About Us
  {{/link-to}}
</div>
{{#list-filter
   filter=(action 'filterByCity')
   as |rentals|}}
  <ul class="results">
    {{#each rentals as |rentalUnit|}}
      <li>{{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
{{/list-filter}}
{{outlet}}
```

Having a parent route means that any content on our parent route template will be present as we browse down through our child routes, allowing us to add things like common instructions, navigation, footers or sidebars.

## Generating a Nested Index Route

The first nested route to generate will be the index route.
An index nested route works similarly to the base index route.
It is the default route that renders when no route is provided.
Therefore in our case, when we navigate to `/rentals`, Ember will attempt to load the rentals index route as a nested route.

To create an index nested route, run the following command:

```shell
ember g route rentals/index
```

If you open up your Router (`app/router`) you may notice that nothing has updated.

```app/router.js
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');
  this.route('rentals');
});
```

Much like how our application's `index` route doesn't appear in our Router, `index` routes on sub-routes won't explicitly appear in the Router either.
Ember knows that the default action is to take the user to the `index` route.
However, you can add the `index` route if you want to customize it.
For example, you can modify the `index` route's path by specifying `this.route('index', { path: '/custom-path'})`.

In the section on [using Ember Data](../ember-data#toc_updating-the-model-hook), we added a call to fetch all rentals. 
Let's implement our newly generated `rentals/index` route by moving this `findAll` call from the parent `rentals` route to our new sub-route.

```app/routes/rentals.hbs{-2,-3,-4}
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model() {
    return this.store.findAll('rental');
  }
});
```

```app/routes/rentals/index.js{+2,+3,+4}
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model() {
    return this.store.findAll('rental');
  }
});
```

Now that we are returning all of our rentals to the nested route's model, we will also move the rental list markup from our main route template to our nested route index template.

```app/templates/rentals.hbs{-9,-10,-11,-12,-13,-14,-15,-16,-17}
<div class="jumbo">
  <div class="right tomster"></div>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>We hope you find exactly what you're looking for in a place to stay.</p>
  {{#link-to 'about' class="button"}}
    About Us
  {{/link-to}}
</div>
{{#list-filter
   filter=(action 'filterByCity')
   as |rentals|}}
  <ul class="results">
    {{#each rentals as |rentalUnit|}}
      <li>{{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
{{/list-filter}}
{{outlet}}
```

```app/templates/rentals/index.hbs{+1,+2,+3,+4,+5,+6,+7,+8,+9}
{{#list-filter
   filter=(action 'filterByCity')
   as |rentals|}}
  <ul class="results">
    {{#each rentals as |rentalUnit|}}
      <li>{{rental-listing rental=rentalUnit}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
{{/list-filter}}
{{outlet}}
```

Finally, we need to make our controller that has our filter action available to the new nested index route.
Instead of moving the whole controller file over to `app/controller/rentals/index.js` from `app/controller/rentals.js`, we'll just take advantage of the route's `controllerName` property to just point at our existing `rentals` controller.

```app/routes/rentals/index.js{+2}
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  controllerName: 'rentals',
  model() {
    return this.store.findAll('rental');
  }
});
```

## Setting up Data for the Nested Detail Route

Next, we will want to create a sub-route that will list information for a specific rental.
To do this, we will need to update a couple of files.
To find a specific rental, we will want to use Ember Data's `findRecord` function [(see "Finding Records" for more details)](../../models/finding-records/).
The `findRecord` function requires that we search by a unique key.

While on the `show` route, we will also want to show additional information about our specific rental.

In order to do this, we need to modify the Mirage `config.js` file.
If you need a refresher on how Mirage works, go back to the [Installing Addons section](../installing-addons)
We will add a new route handler to mirage to handle when the http request comes in to fetch a rental.

```mirage/config.js{+55,+56,+57,+58}
export default function() {
  let rentals = [
    {
      type: 'rentals',
      id: 'grand-old-mansion',
      attributes: {
        title: "Grand Old Mansion",
        owner: "Veruca Salt",
        city: "San Francisco",
        type: "Estate",
        bedrooms: 15,
        image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Crane_estate_(5).jpg",
        description: "This grand old mansion sits on over 100 acres of rolling hills and dense redwood forests."
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'rentals',
      id: 'urban-living',
      attributes: {
        title: "Urban Living",
        owner: "Mike Teavee",
        city: "Seattle",
        type: "Condo",
        bedrooms: 1,
        image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Alfonso_13_Highrise_Tegucigalpa.jpg",
        description: "A commuters dream. This rental is within walking distance of 2 bus stops and the Metro."
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'rentals',
      id: 'downtown-charm',
      attributes: {
        title: "Downtown Charm",
        owner: "Violet Beauregarde",
        city: "Portland",
        type: "Apartment",
        bedrooms: 3,
        image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Wheeldon_Apartment_Building_-_Portland_Oregon.jpg",
        description: "Convenience is at your doorstep with this charming downtown rental. Great restaurants and active night life are within a few feet."
      }
    }
  ];

  this.get('/rentals', function(db, request) {
    if (request.queryParams.city !== undefined) {
      let filteredRentals = rentals.filter(function (i) {
        return i.attributes.city.toLowerCase().indexOf(request.queryParams.city.toLowerCase()) !== -1;
      });
      return { data: filteredRentals };
    } else {
      return { data: rentals };
    }
  });

  this.get('/rentals/:id', function (db, request) {
    //Finds and returns the provided rental from our rental list
    return { data: rentals.find((rental) => request.params.id === rental.id) };
  });

};

```

## Generating a Nested Detail Route

Now that our API is ready to return individual rentals, we can generate our `show` sub-route.
Much like generating our `rentals` route, we will use `ember g` to create a nested route.

```shell
ember g route rentals/show
```

You will see output like this:

```shell
installing route
  create app/routes/rentals/show.js
  create app/templates/rentals/show.hbs
updating router
  add route rentals/show
installing route-test
  create tests/unit/routes/rentals/show-test.js
```

Let's start by looking at the changes to our Router (`app/router.js`).

```app/router.js
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');
  this.route('rentals', function() {
    this.route('show');
  });
});
```

You will notice that `this.route('show')` is nested within our `rentals` route.
This tells Ember that it is a sub-route and must be accessed through `localhost:4200/rentals/show`.

In order for us to tell the application which rental we want to access, we need to replace the `show` route path with the ID of the rental listing you are viewing.
In addition, we will want to simplify the URL for the user so that they can access the information for a specific rental by browsing to `localhost:4200/rentals/id-for-rental`.

To do this, we modify our router as follows:

```app/router.js{+5}
Router.map(function() {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact');
  this.route('rentals', function() {
    this.route('show', { path: '/:rental_id' });
  });
});
```

We have modified the `path` for the `show` route.
It no longer defaults to `/rentals/show` but instead `/rentals/:rental_id`.
This means we can now access the `rental_id` on the route itself.


## Finding By ID

Next, we will want to edit our `show` route to return the specific rental we want.

```app/routes/rentals/show.js{+2,+3,+4}
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model(params) {
    return this.store.findRecord('rental', params.rental_id);
  }
});
```

Since we added `:rental_id` to the `show` path in our router, we can now access `rental_id` through the `params` in our `model` hook.
When we call `this.get('store').findRecord('rental', params.rental_id)`, Ember Data makes an HTTP GET request to `/rentals/our-id`.
You can read more about Ember Data in the [Models section](../../models/) of the guides, 
and read about the `findRecord` method of the Ember Data store service in the [API Documentation](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Store.html#method_findRecord).

To ensure that we are properly interfacing with Ember Data, we'll write a unit test that confirms `findRecord` is called with the correct parameters.
Since we are already leveraging ember-cli-mirage for our app persistence in this tutorial, we'll leverage it for our route test to act as a stub for the HTTP request that gets generated when we fetch our rental.

Mirage will automatically start when the app starts for an acceptance test, but since we are writing a unit test, the same application start logic is not executed.
Therefore we need to [start Mirage manually within our test](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/docs/v0.2.x/manually-starting-mirage/). 

Create an ember test helper by running the following command:

```shell
ember g test-helper setup-mirage-for-unit-test
```

The command creates a test helper file in your `tests/helpers` directory.
Test helpers are utilities that can be shared between test cases.
Update the file contents as shown below:

```tests/helpers/setup-mirage-for-unit-test.js
import mirageInitializer from '../../initializers/ember-cli-mirage';

export default function startMirage(container) {
  mirageInitializer.initialize(container);
}
```

Now let's edit the unit test that Ember created for us when we generated our `show` route.

```tests/unit/routes/rentals/show-test.js
import { moduleFor, test } from 'ember-qunit';
import startMirage from '../../../helpers/setup-mirage-for-unit-test';
import Ember from 'ember';

moduleFor('route:rentals/show', 'Unit | Route | rentals/show', {
  needs: ['model:rental'],
  beforeEach() {
    startMirage(this.container);
  },
  afterEach() {
    window.server.shutdown();
  }
});

test('should load rental by id', function(assert) {
  let route = this.subject();
  Ember.run(() => {
    route.model({ rental_id: 'grand-old-mansion'}).then((result) => {
      assert.equal(result.get('title'), "Grand Old Mansion");
    });
  });
});
```

In the above unit test we are directly calling the `model` hook method with our rental_id as an argument.
We then process the resulting promise by asserting that the result has the appropriate title, validating that the correct record was returned.

Also note that in the `beforeEach` hook, we are starting Mirage using the helper we just created, and in the `afterEach` hook we shut down the mirage instance created during start.

## Adding the Rental To Our Template

Next, we can update the template for our show route (`app/templates/rentals/show.hbs`) and list the information for our rental.

```app/templates/rentals/show.hbs
<div class="jumbo">
  <a href="#" class="button right up-11">Edit</a>
  <h2 style="margin-bottom:15px">{{model.title}}</h2>
  <div class="right" style="width:50%;padding-left:30px">
    <div class="map right" style="background: url({{model.address}}) center center;"></div>
    <div class="detail" style="margin-top:10px">
      <strong>Owner:</strong> {{model.owner}}
    </div>
    <div class="detail">
      <strong>Type:</strong> {{rental-property-type model.type}} - {{model.type}}
    </div>
    <div class="detail">
      <strong>Location:</strong> {{model.city}}
    </div>
    <div class="detail">
      <strong>Number of bedrooms:</strong> {{model.bedrooms}}
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>{{nmodel.description}}</p>
  </div>
  <img src="{{model.image}}" alt="" class="" style="width:50%;height:initial;position:static">
</div>
```

We pass our `model` to the `rental-listing` component and add a new section listing the rental's `title`.
Browse to `localhost:4200/rentals/grand-old-mansion` and you should see the information listed for that specific rental.

![Rental Page Nested Show Route](../../images/subroutes/subroutes-super-rentals-show.png)

## Linking to a Specific Rental

Now that we can load pages for individual rentals, we'll provide a `link-to` within our `rental-listing` component to navigate there from our main rentals page.
Clicking on the rental title will load the detail page for the given rental.
Note that passing the `rental` model object to the `link-to` helper will by default route to the model's `id` property.

```app/templates/components/rental-listing.hbs{+6}
<article class="listing">
  <a {{action 'toggleImageSize'}} class="image {{if isWide "wide"}}">
    <img src="{{rental.image}}" alt="">
    <small>View Larger</small>
  </a>
  <h3>{{link-to rental.title "rentals.show" rental}}</h3>
  <div class="detail owner">
    <span>Owner:</span> {{rental.owner}}
  </div>
  <div class="detail type">
    <span>Type:</span> {{rental-property-type rental.type}} - {{rental.type}}
  </div>
  <div class="detail location">
    <span>Location:</span> {{rental.city}}
  </div>
  <div class="detail bedrooms">
    <span>Number of bedrooms:</span> {{rental.bedrooms}}
  </div>
  {{location-map location=rental.city}}
</article>
```

## Final Check

At this point all our tests should pass, including our [battery of acceptance tests](../acceptance-test) we created as our beginning requirements. 

![Acceptance Tests Pass](../../images/subroutes/all-acceptance-pass.png)

At this point you can go to [deployment](../deploying) and share your Super Rentals application to the world, 
or you can use this as a base to explore other Ember features and addons.
Regardless, we hoped this has helped you get started with creating your own ambitious applications with Ember!
